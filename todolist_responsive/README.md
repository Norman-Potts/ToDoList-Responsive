This project is my best To Do App. 
To run this app use "npm run App".
This app has a create react app, and a nodejs server.
The create react app still has the npm run scripts attacheds such as 'start', 'build'.


The goal of this project is to make a good looking to do list that uses my own CSS, rather than a bootstrap CSS.

Improvements needed for this project.
Improve responsive design for desktop, make this centerned and not so wide. 
Keep mobile design good.
